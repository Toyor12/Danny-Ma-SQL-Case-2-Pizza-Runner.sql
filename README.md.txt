# Introduction

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - “80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!”
Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!
Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

# Problem Statement
As the service gains traction, there's a pressing need to optimize the operations by leveraging collected data. The objective is to clean and analyze the existing database, enabling Danny to make data-driven decisions to improve delivery times, order management, and overall customer satisfaction.

# Data source
Danny company provided the data to be used for the analysis to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions! The 3 key datasets for this case study are:
- **runners**
- **customer_orders**
- **runner_orders**
- **pizza_names**
- **pizza_recipes**
- **pizza_toppings**

Runner 3 had the lowest average time while Runner 2 had the highest avg time, the difference between the average time 
might be due to the distance they had to cover to reach the HQ.

3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
![image](https://github.com/Taofik06/Pizza-Runner/assets/123642327/9770e916-a095-497d-b7ec-d55ef55d412c)

Yes, there is a positive relationship between the number of pizzas and the time taken, the higher the number of pizza, the more time taken to prepare.

4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

For this, there is need to create  table, and that is done below.

# Recommendations:
## Product Recommendations:
- Introducing variations or promotional offers around Meatlovers Pizza can further boost its sales due its popularity among customers
- Introducing new pizza types or limited-time offers to cater to the Vegetarian audience to level up its demand and sales.

## Operational Recommendations:
- Provide training or incentives to other runners to enhance their delivery efficiencies, drawing inspiration from Runner 1.
- Pizza runner should focus on reducing the 30-minute delivery time discrepancy for better customer service and satisfaction
- Given the rush during afternoon and nighttime, especially on Wednesdays & Saturdays, the company might consider staffing adjustments and promotional offers during off-peak hours to balance the demand.
  
## Pricing Strategy:
- The Company should consider introducing tiered pricing or bundle offers which could include popular pizzas with extras.
-- Assess the feasibility and customer reception of the $1 charge for pizza extras to determine its long-term implementation.

Danny's innovative Pizza Runner venture has a good foundation. With the insights derived from the data and by actioning the above recommendations, there's great potential for optimizing operations and enhancing customer satisfaction.
